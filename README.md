# CRUT - Campus Resource Utilization Tracker

## Overview

CRUT is a comprehensive system designed to monitor and optimize the usage of campus facilitiesâ€”such as classrooms, labs, and lecture halls. By leveraging PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension, CRUT uses advanced SQL queries, stored procedures, and functions to forecast room occupancy and schedule proactive maintenance. An interactive web-based dashboard provides real-time insights into occupancy trends, scheduling conflicts, and geospatial visualization of facilities.
